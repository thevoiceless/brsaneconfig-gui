GUI for Brother's brsaneconfig3 utility
=====

This is a simple Python/Qt GUI that interfaces with Brother's brsaneconfig3 utility. Every time my printer's IP address changes, I have to set it up again. I got tired of repeatedly looking up the commands and I wanted an excuse to mess with Qt, so I made this.

### Dependencies
* Python (written for 2.7, might work with 3.x)
* PyQt
