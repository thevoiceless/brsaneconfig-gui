GUI for Brother's brsaneconfig3 utility
=====

This is a simple Python/Qt GUI that interfaces with Brother's brsaneconfig3 utility. I usually have to redo the setup of my printer every time its IP address changes. I got tired of repeatedly looking up the commands and I wanted an excuse to mess with Qt, so I made this.

### Dependencies
* Python (written for 2.7, might work with 3.x)
* PyQt4
* [brsaneconfig3](http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_scn1.html)
